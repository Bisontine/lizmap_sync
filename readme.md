Pre-requisites :
QGIS Desktop 2.12 et son plugin Lizmap, Owncloud

Lizmap_sync aims to encourage the publication of webmapping projects by simplifying it in three steps.

1. Creation of QGIS project : selection of layers, symbology, scale dependent visibility, etc.

2. Preparation of Lizmap configurations with the plugin : choice of base map, filling metadata, etc.

3. Publication online with Owncloud : the user shares his directory with Lizmap's user. Then, lizmap_sync scripts publish the mapping project online.
