Lizmap_Sync allows you to share spatial data on OwnCloud and to publish them on the web, thanks to a Lizmap server.

Pre-requisites :
- QGIS Desktop 2.12 and its Lizmap plugin ;
- OwnCloud server ;
- Lizmap server.

Lizmap_sync aims to encourage the publication of webmapping projects by simplifying it in three steps.

1. Creation of QGIS project : selection of layers, symbology, scale dependent visibility, etc.

2. Preparation of Lizmap configurations with the plugin : choice of base map, filling metadata, etc.

3. Publication online with Owncloud : the user shares his directory with Lizmap's user. Then, lizmap_sync scripts publish the mapping project online.
